Project Management · AI Architecture · Multidisciplinary Leadership

These case studies represent a selection of AI implementation projects in which I served as Project Manager, AI Consultant, and Lead Architect, overseeing each initiative from conception to full deployment.

My responsibilities typically included:

Designing and developing the AI architecture and workflows

Coordinating cross-functional teams (developers, analysts, agronomists, engineers, UX specialists, marketing experts, and operational staff)

Managing requirements, expectations, delivery, and quality

Ensuring strict GDPR and regulatory compliance

Providing training, documentation, and post-deployment strategic support

Because many of these implementations were delivered under white-label agreements, all identifying information has been fully anonymised. Only strategic challenges, technological solutions, and measurable outcomes are described.
